# Find-Dining Search Application

The **Fine-Dining App** has been created to allow users to search for restaurants in their chosen city, see the top rated options, and sort by establishment type. Whether they are looking for lunch, a take-away or a pub, Find-Dining helps the user to make their food decision!

The app has been designed to be straightforward and easy for the user to access, with clear colours, fonts and buttons to create an accessible UI.

This app was my first foray into React Native, having previously used React to create my own NC-News project (which is also available on GitHub).

Should you have any questions or would like any further information, please get in touch!

## Cloning the project

Clone this repo:

```js
```

Then don't forget to hook your local version up to a new GitHub repo, using the below terminal commands (checking the git remotes with each step: git remote -v):

```js
git remote remove origin

git remote add origin <YOUR-GITHUB-URL>
```

Or if you would like to suggest any project changes, please feel free to collaborate and your own push requests to my repo.

## Creating the app

As a React-Native beginner, I chose to use install Expo to start the project. Expo is a toolchain built around React Native which helps to quickly start a universal native app for Android, iOS and the web with JavaScript and React. After following tutorials and reading numerous articles, Expo seemingly offered a great developer experience for developers with no prior experience.

I also used the 'Expo' app on my own Android device during development, to emulate the application.

The Zomato API is used to make the restaurant information requests based on location. An initial request has to be made following a users search for the corresponding _city_id_, after which the relevant requests for the restaurant data could be made.

## Project Dependencies

The following dependencies were required to build the Find-Dining app:
